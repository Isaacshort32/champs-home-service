## Current Situation

### Team Structure
- **Isaac** - Owner, operations/management (based in Ohio, managing remotely)
- **Taylor** - Sub-contractor who does basically everything on the ground (cleaning, invoicing, answering calls, etc.) - paid a percentage
- **Two other owners** - Not very involved day-to-day

### Business Status
- Already running (has been for years)
- Has existing customers
- Side hustle currently
- ~2 jobs per week
- ~$25-30k annual revenue (low)
- No current online presence (no website, no social media)

### How Customers Find Them
- Unknown/unclear - likely word of mouth

### Plan
- Isaac is supposed to take over and run the business (remote management, not cleaning)

### Pain Points
- **Missed calls** - Taylor often doesn't answer the phone
- **Low ambition** - Taylor not pushing to grow or hustle for more work
- **Low job volume** - Only ~2 jobs/week, not enough getting done
- **Remote management challenge** - Isaac is in Ohio, business is in Bend

## Website Goals
- Request quotes
- Contact form (helps with missed calls problem)
- Show results/portfolio of work
- Look professional/legitimate

## Tools & Systems

### Jobber

- **Account Owner:** Kevin (everyone else is admin)
- **Preference:** Clients pay via CC so it feeds through Jobber

- Also track jobs on Excel contractor payment sheet (Kevin has access)

- Forwards calls to personal phone when clients call the Champs number
